### Overview
For those wanting something new to read or curious about what others are reading, this application allows them to discover what books are currently trending. The New York Times Best Seller's Lists pulled in this API call are published weekly, so the data refreshes each week, which ensures users will have the most current data. Users can select specific book lists based on interest to view the top books in that category according to rank. From ranked lists, users can select specific books to learn more about them. Users can determine whether or not a book on the list appeals to them and is worth their investment of time and money.

### Preparation and Planning
#### Trello
Preparation began with thorough review of project requirements. First steps included initial project planning followed by review of various API's. Once the API was selected, the project was planned in detail using a Trello board to establish deadlines and key milestones.

#### Github & Figma
Next steps included decision on MVP for this app, composition of basic user stories, and opening a new Github repository. After that, a component hierarchy was sketched in Figma along with wireframe diagrams of layouts in order to map out the architecture of the application ahead of time.
