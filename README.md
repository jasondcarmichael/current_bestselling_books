# current_bestselling_books

## Description
Front-end application built with React.js and third party API (New York Times Bestselling Books Lists)<br>

### Deployed Site
https://current-bestsellers.surge.sh/

### Overview
For those searching for something new to read or curious about what others are reading, this application allows them to see what books are currently trending. The New York Times Best Seller's Lists pulled in this API call are published weekly, so the data refreshes each week. Users can select specific lists based on interest to view the top books in that category according to rank. From ranked lists, users can select specific books to view more details about them. Users can determine whether or not a book on the list appeals to them and is worth their investment of time to read it and / or money to purchase it.
